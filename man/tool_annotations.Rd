\usage{
tool_annotations(
  title = NULL,
  read_only_hint = NULL,
  open_world_hint = NULL,
  idempotent_hint = NULL,
  destructive_hint = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{title}{A human-readable title for the tool.}

\item{read_only_hint}{If \code{TRUE}, the tool does not modify its environment.}

\item{open_world_hint}{If \code{TRUE}, the tool may interact with an "open world"
of external entities. If \code{FALSE}, the tool's domain of interaction is
closed. For example, the world of a web search tool is open, but the world
of a memory tool is not.}

\item{idempotent_hint}{If \code{TRUE}, calling the tool repeatedly with the same
arguments will have no additional effect on its environment. (Only
meaningful when \code{read_only_hint} is \code{FALSE}.)}

\item{destructive_hint}{If \code{TRUE}, the tool may perform destructive updates
to its environment, otherwise it only performs additive updates. (Only
meaningful when \code{read_only_hint} is \code{FALSE}.)}

\item{...}{Additional named parameters to include in the tool annotations.}
}
\value{
A list of tool annotations.
}
\description{
Tool annotations are additional properties that can be used to describe a
tool to clients, for example a Shiny app or another user interface.

The annotations in \code{tool_annotations()} are drawn from the \href{https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction}{Model Context Protocol} and are considered
\emph{hints}. Tool authors should use these annotations to communicate tool
properties, but users should note that these annotations are not guaranteed.
