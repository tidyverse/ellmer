\description{
This function uploads a file then waits for Gemini to finish processing it
so that you can immediately use it in a prompt.

Uploaded files are automatically deleted after 2 days. Each file must be
less than 2 GB and you can upload a total of 20 GB. ellmer doesn't currently
provide a way to delete files early; please
\href{https://github.com/tidyverse/ellmer/issues}{file an issue} if this would
be useful for you.
