        Three Statistician Jokes\n\n**1. The Optimist and the Pessimist**\nA statistician
        told her friend: \"I never fly with just one plane ticket anymoreâ€”I always
        book two flights!\" Her friend asked why, and she explained: \"Well, the odds
        of there being a bomb on a plane are 1 in a million, but the odds of there
        being TWO bombs on the same plane are 1 in a billion. Much safer!\"\n\n**2.
        The Cold Statistician**\nThree statisticians go hunting. They spot a deer.
        The first statistician shoots and misses one meter to the left. The second
        statistician shoots and misses one meter to the right. The third statistician
        jumps up and down shouting, \"We got it! We got it!\"\n\n**3. The Average
        Problem**\nA statistician drowned crossing a river that was, on average, only
        three feet deep.\n\n---\n\n*These jokes capture the classic stereotype of
        statisticians being overly focused on averages, probabilities, and theoretical
        calculations while sometimes missing practical reality!*"}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":14,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":237,"service_tier":"standard"}}'
