        are three jokes about statisticians:\n\n1. **The Drowning Statistician**\nA
        statistician is drowning in a lake that''s on average only 3 feet deep. When
        asked how this could happen, he gasps: \"Well, it was 2 feet deep for most
        of the way across, but then there was this 50-foot section...\"\n\n2. **The
        Confident Statistician**\nA statistician''s wife is having a baby. After the
        delivery, he asks the doctor, \"Is it a boy or a girl?\" The doctor replies,
        \"Well, I can tell you with 95% confidence that it''s one of the two.\"\n\n3.
        **The Literal Statistician**\nThree statisticians go hunting. They spot a
        deer 100 yards away. The first statistician shoots and misses 5 feet to the
        left. The second shoots and misses 5 feet to the right. The third statistician
        jumps up and yells, \"We got him!\"\n\nThese jokes play on common statistical
        concepts like averages being misleading, confidence intervals, and the difference
        between theoretical accuracy and practical results!"}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":14,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":249,"service_tier":"standard"}}'
